First assignment for Compiler Design which is a lexical analyzer that scans and tokenizes a given source file of the CD20 programming language

CD20 is a specific programming language designed for the compiler design course

Every keyword, variable declaration, functions, main function etc in the source file are turned into Token objects 

Anything that is lexically invalid is also transformed into a TUNDF (token undefined) and reported as a lexical error
